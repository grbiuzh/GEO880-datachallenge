<!-- What do you expect, anticipate? -->

## Data
For this project we use the data set with the movement data of the deer which was provided. In addition, we will use data with vegetation information, either geodata from the canton of Zurich or the raster values from the Swiss "Arealstatistik". Which data will be used must first be compared with the literature on deer to know which vegetation has an influence on deer and how strong. 

## Analytical concepts
<!-- Which analytical concepts will you use? What conceptual movement spaces and respective modelling approaches of trajectories will you be using? What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## R concepts
<!-- Which R concepts, functions, packages will you mainly use. What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## Risk analysis
<!-- What could be the biggest challenges/problems you might face? What is your plan B? -->

## Questions? 
<!-- Which questions would you like to discuss at the coaching session? -->
